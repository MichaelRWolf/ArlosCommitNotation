# Migrating from V1 to V2

| V1 | V2 |
| - | - |
| `x - ` | `. X` |
| `X - ` | `^ X` |
| `X!!` | `! X` |
| `X**` | `@ X` |

- Consistent casing; lower case becomes `.` and upper case becomes `^`. Neither combine risk and intention in the same place.
- Risk before intention
- Risk is a single character
- `*` becomes `@`
